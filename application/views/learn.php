               IP Addresses
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: normal;">Every device on your home network is automatically assigned its' own address when it is connected to your router. This is known as an <i>Internet Protocol (IP)</i> address. You can think of these IP addresses in the same way as your home address! Each device will be assigned a unique address, so that other devices know where it lives and how to get in touch with it. An example of an IP address might look something like this: <i><b>192.168.0.1</b></i></p>

               Ports
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: normal;">A port is used to identify a specific program behind an IP address. (See above). Programs can really use any port within the range of 0 to 65535. The first 1024 ports are generally reserved for important programs needed by most systems, or 'most used/common' programs that are widely accepted. For example, if you wanted to be able to print to your wireless printer from your laptop or phone, you would have to set the printing program to look for your home IP address, followed by the printing port. This might look something like this: <i><b>https://192.168.0.1:9100</b></i>. A port must be set to 'open' in order to be used.</p>

               Why does this matter?
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: normal">In Cyber Security, a principle of 'least privilege' is generally considered good practice. What this means is, you should only ever open the ports that you absolutely need in order to make things work for you. Opening ports that aren't needed can lead to malicious hackers gaining access to your network. Keeping track of the ports you've opened before and whether they are still needed can be a little daunting at first, and that's where HomeSec comes in. By scanning your network and reading the results, you can easily determine which devices have ports open, and you can then research whether they actually needd to be or whether they can be closed.</p>
